## Project Description

The main objective of this project was training our skills on obtaining data from different sources, safely storing in a data base and generate an analysis with relevant visualization.
In this project, we thought of a topic, found the data, completed an end-to-end analysis and presented the data in multiple ways. 
I choose a topic of interest to me: Covid and the impact on brazilian job loss - and understood all the data and research that had already been done in that area. I found the data from DATA SUS API, IBGE and Our World in Data.

## ðŸ›  Tools

Python, Jupyter Notebook, Pandas, BeautifulSoup, Tableau

##  ðŸ’» Aggregation and Analysis:

The information was collected and all de data sources previously informed, all the aggregation and analysis were made with pandas and Tableau
I relates all the information by data in order to obtain the answer I was looking for: How big was the impact of the COVID on Brazilian job loss?. Got the conclusion that the impact was huge but we have already managed to recover in terms of unemployment rate.

Considering the very limited time to perform analysis on this dataset and the analysis techniques that I know at the moment, with some effort I could obtain my results.
