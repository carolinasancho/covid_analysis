## Project Description

The main objective of this project was training our skills on obtaining data from different sources and safely storing in a data base, and generate an analysis with relevant visualization
In this project, we thought of a topic, found the data, completed an end-to-end analysis and presented the data in multiple ways. 
I choose a topic of interest to me: Covid and the impact on brazilian job loss - and understood all the data and research that had already been done in that area. I found the data from DATA SUS API, IBGE and Our World in Data.
